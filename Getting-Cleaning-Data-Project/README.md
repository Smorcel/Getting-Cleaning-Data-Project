# README

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in Coursera.

CodeBook.md describes how to use run_analysis.R, variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. You have to import the file before using it in RStudio.

The output of the 5th step is called SecondTidySet.txt, and uploaded in the course project's repository.# Getting-and-cleaning-data---Week-4---Project
